## **About The Course**

In the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will open the deep learning black box to understand the processes that drive performance and generate good results systematically. 

By the end, you will learn the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications; be able to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.


## **Repository Structure**

This repository is organized into four weeks of study materials. It includes:

- Lecture notes
- Essential datasets and figures for the notes

## **Prerequisites**

This course should be taken after: 

- Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## **How to Use This Repository**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the course on Coursera and use these materials as a supplementary resource.

## **Contributions**

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request.

## **Acknowledgments**

Please appreciate the effort put into the creation and maintenance of these resources. All materials are intended for personal use and educational purposes.
